# What is this?

Here you can find the config files I use for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Feel free to explore them and use them.

# Where should I save these files?

First, locate where your game folder is. Usually **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive** in Windows and something similar in other OSs.
The **.cfg** files (*autoexec* and *prac*) and the video settings (video.txt) should be saved in **csgo\cfg**. The **radiopanel** file should be saved in **csgo\resource\ui**. The **csgo_bananagaming** file should be saved in **csgo\resource**. The **launch options** file shouldn't be saved anywhere (see below). Read below to find out what each file is doing. You probably don't want every one of them.

## autoexec

This config is executed every time the game is loaded. Here you can find my aliases, binds, configuration options and other cool stuff.

## prac

I use this config when I practice flashes/smokes on a private server. It sets some variables such as *sv_cheats 1* to make the practicing easier. I usually start the config it with *F11* and give nades with *F12* (see *autoexec*), but it can be started with **exec prac** from console.

## radiopanel

Did you know there are some hidden radio commands in the game that you can use? Replace this file and they will appear in the radio menus. [See more info here.](http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=171993722)

## csgo_bananagaming

## launch options

These are the launch options I use to start the game. [Here](https://youtu.be/j9Tuiu5KKPc?t=21s) you can see how to add them. **Be careful!!!** The *-threads* and *-freq* options should be individual to everyone, otherwise you can harm your hardware. You have been warned.
