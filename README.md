# What is this?

Here you can find the config files I use for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Feel free to explore them and use them.

# Where should I save these files?

First, locate where your game folder is. Usually **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive** in Windows and something similar in other OSs.
The **.cfg** files (*autoexec* and *prac*) should be saved in **csgo\cfg** folder. The **radiopanel** file should be saved in **csgo\resource\ui**.

## autoexec

This config is executed every time the game is loaded. Here you can find my aliases, binds, configuration options and other cool stuff.

## prac

I use this config when I practice flashes/smokes on a private server. It sets some variables such as *sv_cheats 1* to make the practicing easier. I usually start the config it with *F11* and give nades with *F12* (see *autoexec*), but it can be started with **exec prac** from console.

## radiopanel

Did you know there are some hidden radio commands in the game that you can use? Replace this file and they will appear in the radio menus. [See more info here.](http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=171993722)
